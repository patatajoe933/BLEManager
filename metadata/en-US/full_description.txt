The BLE Manager app for Android simplifies managing your device’s characteristics.
No additional libraries are required to use the app with your device. Annotate each characteristic with a descriptor specifying the data type, graphical component, and optional properties like minimum and maximum values. That’s all! Once connected, the app automatically displays the described characteristics, enabling you to read and modify their values. All components fully support notifications and indications from your device for seamless interaction.
